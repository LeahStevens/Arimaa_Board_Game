Arimaa
=============

Creating the board game Arimaa using JQuery and other things.


Currently working on: 
1) Enforcing 4 move limit to each players turn.
2) Making the board multiplayer.
3) Board logic. Ex: When a weaker piece is beside an opposing stronger piece, the weaker piece gets frozen.
   A) Weaker pieces are frozen.
   B) Stronger pieces can push and pull weaker pieces. (Counts as 2 moves in a turn)
   C) Board has to change at the end of each turn.
