Arimaa
=============

Creating the board game Arimaa using JQuery and other things.


Currently working on: 
1. [] Enforcing 4 move limit to each players turn.
2. [] Making the board multiplayer.
3. [] Board logic. Ex: When a weaker piece is beside an opposing stronger piece, the weaker piece gets frozen.
	- [] Weaker pieces are frozen.
  - [] Stronger pieces can push and pull weaker pieces. (Counts as 2 moves in a turn)
	- [] Board has to change at the end of each turn.
